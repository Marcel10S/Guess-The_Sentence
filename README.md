# Guess_The_Sentence

Game that use java swing and some string transforming.

The game is about entering letters and guessing the secret sentence in as few attempts as possible. At the end the average number of moves are converted into the result. 
Feel free to check folder out and then artifacts to download the executable jar or to view the code in the src directory and then com/company. The project is made of the need
to write something nice where I will use java skills and I will not bore everyone :) In the future I plan refactoring to SOLID rules and better code quality, option to add 
your own sentence and categories of sentences.

Have fun while playing
